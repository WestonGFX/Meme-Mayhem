## Game Overview

**Pepe's Meme Mayhem** is a fast–paced roguelite shooter where every run is a unique, meme-filled adventure. Inspired by the gameplay of *The Binding of Isaac*, it features procedurally generated dungeons, randomized enemy spawns, deep resource management, and, most importantly, a robust synergy system. Every item—from coins to power-ups—interacts in unpredictable ways, leading to explosive, chain–reacting effects that can clear entire rooms if you manage your build correctly.

Set in a world where Twitch memes, rare Pepe imagery, and internet culture collide, the game offers a tongue-in-cheek experience that is both challenging and entertaining. Whether you're battling bosses that adapt to your synergy build or exploring rooms filled with hidden secrets, every playthrough is different, ensuring endless replayability.

## Features

- **Procedurally Generated Dungeons:** 
  - Randomized rooms with obstacles, enemies, loot, and secret areas.
  
- **Deep Synergy System:** 
  - Items interact in unexpected ways. For example, combining "Heat Rocket" with "Attack Speed" can spawn additional projectiles leading to explosive chain reactions.
  
- **Resource Management:**
  - Manage coins, bombs, keys, hearts, tarot cards, and rerolls to optimize your build and survive longer runs.
  
- **Dynamic Boss Battles:**
  - Boss enemies that transform based on your synergy build, with multiple phases and evolving attack patterns.
  
- **Interactive Environments:**
  - Bombable walls, donation machines, and beggars add an extra layer of strategy.
  
- **Unique Shop System:**
  - In–game shop offers upgrades and “meme packs” that temporarily alter synergy rules.
  
- **Time–Shift Effects:**
  - Trigger temporary slow-motion effects to emphasize cascading synergy interactions.
  
- **Robust Audio & Visual Effects:**
  - Particle effects, screen shakes, and a dynamic soundtrack enhance the chaotic gameplay experience.
  
- **Modding API:**
  - Easily extend the game with custom items, synergy rules, and enemy behaviors.
  
- **Multiple Tech Stack Options:**
  - The project is designed to be implemented using various technologies (C++ with SDL2, C# with Unity, Godot, JavaScript with Phaser, etc.).

## Gameplay Mechanics

- **Movement & Shooting:**  
  Move using WASD or arrow keys and shoot with the left mouse button. The player rotates to face the mouse cursor.

- **Synergy Overload:**  
  When specific items (e.g., "Heat Rocket" and "Attack Speed") are in your inventory, a synergy overload effect is triggered, amplifying your damage or spawning additional projectiles.

- **Procedural Generation:**  
  Each floor is generated randomly, including room layouts, enemy placements, loot, and environmental hazards.

- **Resource Decisions:**  
  Spend coins at shops, use bombs to destroy walls for hidden rewards, and manage other resources to keep progressing.

- **Boss Battles:**  
  Bosses are not only challenging but adapt based on your synergy builds, providing a fresh challenge every run.
